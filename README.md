# Pinta

Pinta is a small project I have been working on for a number of reasons..

- Wanted to get around directories fast in terminal
- Wanted a tui interface for it
- Wanted to launch tmux in a more efficient way

*Pinta* is a compact, simple tui for navigating directories written in Rust. It is still a work in progress, as many of its important features are not implemented. Here are my goals as to what to implement next

- Cache for frequently visited directories
- .config implementation
- Fzf for directories (config with specific depth searching)
- Better error handling

## Version 2.0

The idea of Version 2.0 is to create an API rewrite, to transform this idea from a small-scaling project into a well-organized model.

All in all, this project has a decent way to go still.
